The in/ directory has sample cluster files to test the program.
It is designed to consist of 50 molecules. Use a cutoff_U of 4
to test this program. 

Sample information:

Sample 1: 
	Fusion: 0+1
        Chain expulsion: 21 (to melt)

Sample 2: 
	Fission: 6
	Chain insertion: 48 (from melt)

Sample 3:
	Fission: 0
	Chain insertion: 21 (from melt)

Sample 4: 
	Stepwise association (no molecules in melt)

Sample 5:
	Stepwise dissociation (8 molecules in melt)
